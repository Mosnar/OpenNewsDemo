      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Ted Cruz sought in a speech Saturday to erase lingering skepticism from Jewish Republicans about his ability to win in November and predicted a Donald Trump nomination would result in a "bloodbath of Walter Mondale proportions."</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"Can Cruz win?"</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">the Texas senator said here at The Venetian hotel before the Republican Jewish Coalition, warning that he would "get a little wonky" before hundreds of leaders.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"The best policy positions in the world don't mean squat if you lose."</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Cruz, acknowledging that he likely disagrees with those in the crowd on immigration and social issues such as gay marriage, noted correctly that he was not the first choice of many Republicans in the room.</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">But he stressed to Jewish leaders here that he was both their best chance to maintain GOP control of Congress -- key to conservative foreign policy hands -- and the best second choice they have in the race, raising the specter of a blowout should Trump lead the GOP ticket.</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"If the top of the ticket is blown out of the water by 10 points, we're losing the Senate.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And there's not a thing that can be done to stop it," Cruz said, saying a Trump candidacy would lead to a "bloodbath of Walter Mondale proportions."</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="subj" autoclass2="subj">Cruz, saying he and the "sophisticated political audience" have "enormous agreement" on policy, instead aimed to convince the Republican Jewish Coalition that a vote for him would not be wasted, outlining in detailed nuts-and-bolts that he has a path to beat Trump and then the Democratic nominee in November.</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Many in this audience of prominent Republican donors feel that while Cruz is in sync with them on protecting Israel, he is too brash in tone and conservative in policy to win.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">On Saturday evening, Cruz tackled that perception head-on.</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And he suggested that the favor Trump had curried with the pro-Israel community thanks to a speech at another Zionist summit, AIPAC, was only so successful because he "read (a) promise off teleprompters."</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">But Cruz's most pressing task was to pitch politics, not policy.</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Cruz on Saturday rested his case more than ever before on an open Republican National Convention, saying "delegate math" was on his side, as he professed that he had a legitimate path to the White House.</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">Cruz said his recent under-the-radar victories in a battery of state delegate battles made it "almost impossible" for Trump to win the 1,237 delegates needed to avoid a contested convention in Cleveland.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And Cruz confidently predicted that he was almost certain to defeat Trump there.</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">"I believe the first ballot will be the highest vote total Donald Trump receives.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="obj" autoclass2="obj">And on a subsequent ballot, we're gonna win the nomination and earn the majority," Cruz said.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">"We have to achieve that unity -- and we've got just over 100 days to do it."</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And in a general election, when some fear Cruz may be too conservative to win?</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">He pledged to not be a "hectoring scold" on issues such as abortion.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">He boasted that he could put states like Pennsylvania in play, rattling off general election polls in a battery of states.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">And he predicted that he <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> be more <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">successful</MPQAPOL> at uniting the Republican Party after a <MPQAPOL autoclass="negative">fractious</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">primary</MPQAPOL> battle than Hillary Clinton <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">would</MPQAPOL> be at coalescing a <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">Democratic</MPQAPOL> Party <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">split</MPQAPOL> between her and Bernie Sanders.</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">Cruz, hyper <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">aware</MPQAPOL> of his audience, <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">knew</MPQAPOL> from the outset that he had people to <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">convince</MPQAPOL>.</MPQASENT> <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="obj">And soon after <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">wishing</MPQAPOL> them a "<MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">Good</MPQAPOL> Shabbos," the Texas senator signaled that he <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">believed</MPQAPOL> they were <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">slowly</MPQAPOL> being won over.</MPQASENT>
      <MPQASENT autoclass1="unknown" autoclass2="subj">"This is a room <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">full</MPQAPOL> of people who are <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">good</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">friends</MPQAPOL>," he said, "and who are becoming <MPQAPOL autoclass="positive">good</MPQAPOL> <MPQAPOL autoclass="neutral">friends</MPQAPOL>."</MPQASENT>
